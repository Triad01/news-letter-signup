## Overview

This is a challenge to build a news letter sign up page with form and also allowing users to submit valid emails.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started with mapping out a structure which I would use.. Although it has a simple layout, I ensured I had it figured out before I started out with coding.
Then I prepared the markup for my home page (index.html) and also the success page which I called success.html after which I their respestive sass files.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to make use of Vanilla Javascript to change the url of the current page. This is important in impleenting routing with windows object

### Continued development

I would be trying out this project again using React Js and see how I can achieve the same result especially when it comes to implementing the email validation logic.
